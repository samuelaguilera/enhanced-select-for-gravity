## Description

This is a simple plugin to demonstrate how to add [Selectize](https://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) support to Gravity Forms Drop Down and Multi Select fields.

During test it has been working pretty fine out of the box using preview and the Twenty Twenty-One theme, both for desktop and mobile devices. But it may require some CSS tweaks for your theme, this is something you will need to test.

You can also replace Selectize with [Select2](https://select2.org/) easily by changing only a few lines.

## Usage

- Activate the plugin.
- After activation you will see a new **Enable Enhanced Select** setting under the Appearance tab for Drop Down and Multiselect fields.

## Support

As said above this is only an example. Feel free to fork it and use it as base for a more elaborated project.
