## Description

This is a simple plugin to demonstrate how to add [Select2](https://select2.org/) or [Selectize](https://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) support to Gravity Forms Drop Down and Multi Select fields.

Consider it as a starter point. 

## Usage

- Activate the plugin.
- After activation you will see new settings under the Appearance tab for Drop Down and Multiselect fields.

**Don't mix the scripts on the same form. Use Select2 or Selectize for all fields within a form.**

## Support

As said above this is only an example. Feel free to fork it and use it as base for a more elaborated project.
